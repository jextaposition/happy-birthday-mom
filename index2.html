<h2>Happy <strong>53rd</strong> Birthday Mom!
  <br>Unfortunately, I was not able to be
  <br>there to celebrate with you, so I made
  <br>you a little card for you to have instead.
  <br>I thank God everyday that He allowed me to
  <br>to have you as my forever mom. A strong,
  <br>God-fearing, loving woman, you will always
  <br>be my role model.
  <br><strong>I love you!</strong>
  <br>Alexa
